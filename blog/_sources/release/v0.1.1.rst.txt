Features
--------

- Add less-then '<' operator
- Offer standardized solution for various logging needs 
- Provide option to skip all PyGears framework related frames in PDB debugger
- Add `unary <https://github.com/bogdanvuk/pygears/blob/master/pygears/lib/unary.py>`_ gear to the lib library, which returns the unary representation of a binary number.
- Speed-up the PyGears simulator by using asycio.future

Infrastructure
--------------

- Factor-out pygears-tools to a `separate repository <https://github.com/bogdanvuk/pygears-tools>`_
- Add `Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/>`_ scripts for testing different PyGears installation methods on different supported OSs 

Bug-fixes
---------

- Echo example can now be simulated completely in Python without an RTL simulator. Simulator is still in experimental stage, since not all gears from the libraries are supported.

  This mode can be invoked when running `plop_test_wav_echo_sim <https://docs.pygears.org/echo.html#running-simulation>`_ by setting ``cosim=False``::

    wav_echo_sim(
        os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'plop.wav'),
        os.path.join('build', 'plop_echo.wav'),
        feedback_gain=0.6,
        delay=0.25,
        cosim=False,
        stereo=False
    )

- Fix `rng <https://github.com/bogdanvuk/pygears/blob/master/pygears/lib/rng.py>`_ for irregular cases where the counting range is not divisible by the step.

- Fix '*' and '+' operations for Integer types
